# CatalogApp

This is a demo app that queries an [AWS Api](http://mobcategories.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/) for a catalog of products.<br/>
The list of returned categories and products is then displayed in the app.<br/>
On clicking an individual product type, the user is shown more details for that product in a new screen.<br/>


Currently in Progress
